They are tailored for big-data and employ parallel and distributed computations to achieve scalability, in terms of memory and computational requirements.\r\nThe code made available here represents a proof of concept MATLAB implementation of the two proposed algorithms.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n* Dr. Alexandru Onose\r\n* Dr. Rafael E.
